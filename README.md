# ML-for-Bank-Transaction
This project analyzes bank transactions using machine learning methods with two main focuses:  Clustering to find natural patterns in transactions and interpret the characteristics of each cluster.  Classification by testing various algorithms, evaluating their performance, and performing hyperparameter tuning to find the best model.
